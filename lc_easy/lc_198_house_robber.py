# LC 198. House Robber (Dynamic Programming)

"""
What the problem is saying in plain English
Imagine a row of houses, each with some amount of cash.
We want to rob houses to get the most money possible.
Rule: We cannot rob two houses in a row â€” if we do, an alarm goes off.


Summary of question: 
Given: An array nums where nums[i] is the amount of money in the i-th house.
Rule: We cannot rob two adjacent houses.
Goal: Return the maximum money you can rob without triggering the alarm.



My approach

Constraint: No two house can be robbed. this means if we rob house i, we must skip house i-1 and go for i-2.

Brute force: Try all combinations using recursion. Rob  current house --> skip next. Skip current house --> rob next. Time complexity O(2^n)
Dynamic Programing: max money upto house i depends only on: 
    i. Robbing i --> money from i + best we can do till i-2
    ii. Skipping i --> best we can do till i-1

# Space Optimized O(1) space version 

def rob_opt(nums):
    # rob1-> best amount if you consider houses upto i-2, rob2 -> best amount if you consider houses up to i-1.
    rob1, rob2 = 0, 0 # Rob1= No houses two step back yet, Rob2= No houses considered yet     

    # (rob1, rob2, n, n+1, ....)
    for n in nums:
        temp = max(n+rob1, rob2) # n+rob1 -> Rob current house (skip previous house, so add value from i-2), rob2 -> skip current house, best so far without robbing this one
        rob1 = rob2 # Shift rob1 to the previous rob2
        rob2 = temp # rob2 becomes the best so far
    return rob2 # time and space complexity O(n) & O(1)

# Classic DP array version
